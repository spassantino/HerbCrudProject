README:

-Herbs was created by Sarah G. Passantino of Skill Distillery in her 7th week of the program. 
-Herbs is a C.R.U.D. web development project assigned to SD7 on the afternoon of Wednesday November 9th. 
-The assignment needed to be finalized by Monday November 14th 12pm and had to use the Spring framework. 
-The goal of the application is to implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) in a way that simulates data read from and written to a database in adherence to a MVC pattern.
-With this application a user can create, read, update and/or delete Herb objects.
-Technologies involved in this project include Java, Spring MVC, JSP, and HTML/CSS.
-If given additional time I would add an option to view herbs grouped by keywords or common data.
-I also would like to incorporate a file or printwriter to save herbs when added in to the ArrayList.
-A stumbling point I encountered was identifying how to order an object to be retrieved by a specific attribute as well as update its value at the same time.
