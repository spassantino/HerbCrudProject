Herbs is a C.R.U.D. project assigned to SD7 on the afternoon of Wednesday November 9th. The assignment needed to be finalized by Monday November 14th 12pm and had to use the Spring framework. The goal of the application is to implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) in a way that simulates data read from and written to a database in adherence to a MVC pattern.

With this application a user can create, read, update and/or delete Herb objects.
